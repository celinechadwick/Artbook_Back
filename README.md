### Read Me
Approach:
  I wanted to link to an external API, and save the desired information into my own database, along with user information for authentication.
I started by getting an API key for the Rijks museum, and creating a rails back-end. I moved all of my search methods to a search route, so that the API key would not be visible on the front-end.

  I then built a React front-end, which allowed users to login or create accounts, and then save their favorite art from the Rails search route.Â I passed the token to Rails, and used a JWT token for authentication.

## Project Issues:
- User is able to add artworks from the Rijks API multiple times
- User is locked out of their account if they forget the password

## Future goals:
- A User should be able to utilize the API color parameter to search artwork by color, after they select a HEX color from a wheel.
  - This will be a React component that makes a call to a rails API call, and passes in the color code they have clicked on
- Users should be able to view more information about artworks, and write posts about each artwork they have liked.
- Users should be able to see who else has liked images, so they can view those profiles
  - Saved collections should not require authentication, so users can view other profiles.
